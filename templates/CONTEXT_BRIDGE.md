# 🌉 Context Bridge — {PROJECT_NAME}

> Auto-generated by CodeFoundry Project Initializer Agent

---

## Purpose

This file serves as a **bridge between CodeFoundry (meta-tool) and this project**. It provides essential context for AI assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) to understand the project's origin and continue work seamlessly.

---

## Origin

**Created from:** [CodeFoundry](../system-prompts/) — System Prompts Meta-Generator

**Parent Location:** `{PARENT_DIR_RELATIVE}`

**Created:** {CREATED_AT}
**Session:** #{SESSION_NUMBER}
**Archetype:** {ARCHETYPE}
**Type:** {PROJECT_TYPE}

---

## Meta-Context

To understand patterns, best practices, and architecture used in this project:

### Primary References

| Reference | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `{PARENT_DIR}/PROJECT.md` | CodeFoundry architecture overview |
| `{PARENT_DIR}/templates/archetypes/{ARCHETYPE}/` | Base archetype used |
| `{PARENT_DIR}/openclaw/README.md` | OpenClaw orchestration pattern |
| `{PARENT_DIR}/openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md` | Agent configuration patterns |

### For AI IDE (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)

When working in this project, the AI should:

1. **Read this CONTEXT_BRIDGE.md first**
   → Understands project origin and meta-context

2. **Read CLAUDE.md (in project root)**
   → Understands role, tech stack, workflow

3. **Read PROJECT.md**
   → Understands complete architecture

4. **Read TASKS.md**
   → Sees current tasks and roadmap

5. **Start with first pending task**
   → Begins work immediately

---

## Initialization Summary

**What was created:**
- Directories: `{DIR_COUNT}` created
- Files: `{FILE_COUNT}` generated
- Git: Initialized
- Initial commit: `{COMMIT_SHA}`

**Parent TASKS.md entry:**
- Phase: `{PHASE}`
- Tasks: INIT-001 through INIT-00{INIT_TASKS_COUNT}
- Status: Complete

---

## Next Steps (for AI Assistant)

### ✅ DO

- Reference parent CodeFoundry via `{PARENT_DIR}` or `../system-prompts/`
- Follow established patterns from archetype
- Start working on first pending task in TASKS.md
- Read project-specific files (CLAUDE.md, PROJECT.md) first

### ❌ DON'T

- Ask user to go back to CodeFoundry for setup
- Re-explain the meta-context (it's here!)
- Create files that should already exist
- Modify parent CodeFoundry without explicit request

---

## Session Context

**Session #{SESSION_NUMBER} Summary:**

```
Project: {PROJECT_NAME}
Type: {PROJECT_TYPE}
Archetype: {ARCHETYPE}

Created Files:
{FILES_LIST}

Next Steps:
- {NEXT_STEP_1}
- {NEXT_STEP_2}
```

---

## Handoff Confirmation

✅ **Project is ready for AI-assisted development**

All critical files are in place.
Context is bridged to parent CodeFoundry.
AI can begin work immediately without confusion.

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Setup
make init              # Setup environment
cp .env.example .env   # Configure environment

# Development
make dev               # Start development server
make test              # Run tests
make lint              # Check code quality

# Deployment
make docker-build      # Build Docker image

## Getting Help

If stuck or confused:

1. **Re-read CLAUDE.md** (in project root) — has detailed instructions
2. **Check PROJECT.md** — complete architecture documentation
3. **Reference parent CodeFoundry** — patterns and best practices
4. **Check TASKS.md** — roadmap and current tasks

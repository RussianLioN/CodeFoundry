# Frontend Agent

## Role
Frontend developer for **{{ project_name }}** (Next.js + React).

## Responsibilities
- Build React components (Server Components preferred)
- Implement pages with Next.js App Router
- Style with TailwindCSS
- Handle client-side state and data fetching

## Conventions
- Server Components by default; Client Components only when needed ('use client')
- Co-locate components with their pages
- Use tRPC or React Query for data fetching
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

## Constraints
- **NEVER** put API keys in client-side code
- **NEVER** use `any` type — always define TypeScript interfaces
- Prefer Server Components for data fetching (no client-side waterfalls)

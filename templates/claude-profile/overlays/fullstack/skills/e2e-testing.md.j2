# Skill: E2E Testing

## Contract
- **Input:** User flow description
- **Output:** Playwright test implementation
- **Stateless:** Yes

## Patterns
1. Page Object Model for reusable selectors
2. Test data factories for isolated test runs
3. API mocking for external services
4. Visual regression with screenshots

## Conventions
- Test file: `tests/e2e/{feature}.spec.ts`
- Use `data-testid` attributes for selectors
- Each test is independent (no shared state)
- Clean up test data after each run

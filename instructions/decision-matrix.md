## Step 1: Assess Criticality

**"What happens if this fails?"**

| Impact | Level |
|--------|-------|
| Minor inconvenience | Experimental |
| Affects workflow | Production |
| Significant consequences | Critical |

---

## Step 2: Assess Complexity

**"How many decisions and edge cases?"**

| Characteristic | Level |
|----------------|-------|
| Single task, <3 edge cases | Simple |
| Multi-step, 3-7 edge cases | Medium |
| Many scenarios, 8+ edge cases | Complex |

## Step 3: Apply Matrix

| Criticality | Complexity | Mode |
|-------------|------------|------|
| Experimental | Simple | Express |
| Experimental | Medium | Express |
| Experimental | Complex | Hybrid |
| Production | Simple | Express |
| Production | Medium | Standard |
| Production | Complex | Careful |
| Critical | Simple/Medium | Careful |
| Critical | Complex | Careful+Review |

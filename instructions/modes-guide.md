# Mode Specifications Guide

## Mode Comparison

| Aspect | Express | Standard | Careful |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Duration** | 5-10 min | 15-30 min | 30-60 min |
| **Questions** | 3-5 focused | 8-12 deep | 12-20 comprehensive |
| **Iterations** | 1 review | Per-block | Per-section + review |
| **User Control** | Low | High | Very High |
| **Best For** | Prototypes, simple | Production, complex | Critical, regulated |

## Express Mode

**Process:**
1. Requirements (3-5 questions): type, task, success criteria
2. Generation: Complete draft internally
3. Review: Single cycle, ask "Что изменить?"

**When:** Simple tasks, prototypes, speed > perfection

---

## Standard Mode

**Process:**
1. Requirements (8-12 questions): Deep dive, edge cases
2. Structure Plan: Present sections, wait approval
3. Block-by-Block: Generate each section, confirm before next
4. Final Assembly: Compile, review

**When:** Production systems, complex tasks, most use cases

---

## Careful Mode

**Process:**
1. Requirements (12-20): Comprehensive, constraints, validation
2. Structure Plan: Detailed breakdown, approval
3. Section-by-Section: Generate with thoroughness checkpoints
4. Validation: Quality checks, test cases
5. Review: Multiple cycles, human review for critical

**When:** Regulated industries, safety systems, high-value
